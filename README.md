# SIMPLE BACKLOG SCRUM

## Introduction

This a simple PHP/Javascript SCRUM backlogs manager.

I was in a training and the guy was explaining us how to manage a dev team SCRUM backlog and I have been surprised of the amount of post-it we have spent to do that!!!

This is just a personal project, there is no security or concurent users management.

## Prerequisites

A simple webserver with PHP enabled is enough to make it work

## Usage
To add a task to the backlog just click the "Add Task" button, it will be directly added to the 'Todo' column.

You can edit the content of a task by just double-cicking it.

Then to move a task between development steps, just drag and drop it on the corresponding colum.

Once you have saved a backlog, you can select it from the "Select a backlog list" to load it again.

To delete a backlog just select it in the list and click the "Delete Selected" button.

You can use the "Reset" button to empty all the backlog workspace (please think to save your work before that).
